Challenges: I tried to use D3 layouts to manipulate the data, and that ended up being super challenging. I'm glad that I knew the basics, but I really wish I had known how to dynamically edit the data structures behind the layouts before I started this project... which ironically was discussed the day this was due. Also, I had wanted to attach anchors to my svgs in my angular directive, but found this hard as well, so it might be nice in future lectures to discuss how new concepts and libraries work, and how to merge previous information with new ideas to create a really interesting thing in class.
